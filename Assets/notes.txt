>>> TODOs

flattening to foreground along vector to camera (allows fancier bullet spawns)
tutorial level that has basic controls, shows your hitbox, shows power ups, deadly collisions with obstacles etc.
main menu with boids as background

>>> loading stuff

have a loadmanager
that loads all the stuff, puts it into the appropriate places (and notifies objects that they are loaded and ready now)
it enables all the objects when it is done loading stuff

>>> pooling

have a pool object
has lists of objects
has static method new that either instantiates a new object if needed or takes one that is currently in the inactive list
(bullets, enemies, etc... stuff that appears and disappears often)

>>> shaders

show compiled code
look around for functions that look like they are what im looking for (such as lightmapping etc)

>> title

daichi ( 大地 ) means earth/ground
chikyū ( 地球 ) means earth/globe
sekai ( 世界 ) means world
Āsudifendā ( アースディフェンダー ) = earth defenders
Taichi bōei-gun ( 対地防衛軍 ) = earth/ground defense force
Sekai no ēsu (世界のエース) = world aces / aces of the world

>> gameplay

around 1 sec to cross the screen
around 1 sec for bullets to go from bottom to top (slowest)
combo doesn't stack forever. there's a max-combo (like x20 or something)
